## Hi there 👋

I'm Stefan, a robotics student at UTCN in Cluj-Napoca.

I approach engineering with a "full-stack" mindset, by understanding every layer of a project. I enjoy working on complete systems, focusing on how hardware and software integrate into a cohesive solution.

My main tech stack is MATLAB/Simulink, C++, AWS (IoT Core, Lambda, DynamoDB), Python, SolidWorks, CATIA, AutoCAD, and Arduino.

Fun Facts:
* **I love coffee**.
* **Interstellar is my favorite movie** .
* **I like to travel** .
